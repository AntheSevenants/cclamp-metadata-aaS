# C-Clamp Metadata as-a-service

This is a small tool to help students be more independent in the ['Verandering en Variatie'](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/2025/syllabi/v/e/F0VJ1A) course. Students upload their corpus results from AntConc and get back rich metadata added to their corpus results. The tool runs entirely in the browser (good for them, good for me). I abuse D3 for some parts of the code. It's not very well made but it serves its purpose.

Included metadata files come from Jozefien Piersoul and Tuur Schokaert.
